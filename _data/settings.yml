blurb: >
  **Sandra Krle's the name, frontend's the game.**
  Iâ€™m a Junior Frontend Developer based in Stockholm, Sweden. 
  I taught myself how to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  Then I did few internships at some really cools start-ups who taught me even more.
  Now I seek me a job. Preferably for juniors who are really fast and awesome at learning.
