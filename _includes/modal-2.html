        Worked with a small team of very smart people on their teaching web app. Here is where I got much better at JavaScript
        and AngularJS. Some examples of my daily tasks included:
      <ul>
        <li>Developing and designing new features of the web app, including UX design</li>
        <li>Writing unit tests with Mocha and e2e tests using Protractor for the new features</li>
        <li>Resolving front end bugs (HTML, CSS, Javascript errors, unit and e2e tests)</li>
      </ul>
