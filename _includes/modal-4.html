        At <a href="https://www.svenskaspel.se/" target="_blank">Svenska Spel</a> I work as a CMS frontend developer.
        The CMS is an inhouse built web app to manage the content on Svenska Spels's web site and game products.

        I am one of three frontend developers in a team of eight persons including backend, UI/UX and a Product Owner.
      </p>
      <p>The frontend stack is React + Redux + Node</p>
      <p>Developing and maintaining the CMS includes: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developing new features (e.g. new types of widgets, banners, time scheduling tools for the content, A/B testing support)</li>
        <li>Maintenance of existing features (bug fixing, rewriting legacy code from Backbone to React, performance optimization, updating of tests)</li>
        <li>Writing unit tests with Enzyme, functional (UI) and integration (API) tests with Mocha and webdriver.io.</li>
        <li>Gathering input from the CMS users in terms of usability and improvements and translating it into requirements</li>
        <li>Close coordination with the back-end developers</li>
      </ul>
