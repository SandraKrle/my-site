<h4>What i'm looking for</h4>
<p>In my experience so far, I've learnt that the most important thing for a Junior/Intermediate is the
<strong>support</strong> and <strong>time</strong> the company is willing to invest.</p>

<p>I can take up lot of your time in the beginning. I will ask many boring and stupid questions.
   I will expect a dedicated mentor who will have the time to properly introduce me to the system,
   closely review my commits and write explanatory comments on how my code can improve.
</p>
<p>I like working in mid-size/big teams, colaborating and learning from smart people and pair-programing.</p>
<p>My mid-term professional goal is to become excelent at React and Node.js, so if you have that in your stack I am in:)</p>
<p>Aaand last but not least, the company has to promote a healthy work-life balance.</p>
