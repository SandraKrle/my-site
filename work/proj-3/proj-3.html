<h4>Personal stuff</h4>
<p>So you’ve made it this far. Yay! Just some personal info here.</p> 
<p>Born and raised in Skopje, Macedonia. Studied and worked in finance for a long time (now feels like another life). Sweden lured my husband with a pretty sweet job offer so I followed along. Also decided to change professions ‘cause finance sucks. He is in IT as well, so he helps a lot.</p>
<p>My hobbies are watching movies and TV series. I try to visit the nature more often, but it’s so cold here. I also like hanging out with humans, drink beer and hear some good music.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, I will try to make friends at work and make Friday AW hangouts a thing (if it's not already).</p>
<p>I believe that cats are the coolest, but can’t own any because allergies.</p>
