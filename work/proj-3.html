<p>So you’ve made it this far. Yay! Just some personal info here.</p> 
<p>Born and raised in Skopje, Macedonia. Studied and work in finance for a long time (now feels like another life). Swedes took away my hubby so I decided to join him. Also decided to change profession ‘cause finance sucks. He’s a QA, so he teaches me computer stuff.</p>
<p>My hobbies are watching movies and TV series. I try to visit the nature more often, but it’s so cold in nature. 
I like to go out for a beer and some music.</p>
<p>I believe that cats are the coolest, but can’t own any because allergies.</p>
