<p>Ok, so you need a Junior in your team. This is what you need to know.</p>
<p>Juniors can take up a lot of your time in the beginning. They ask all this boring and stupid questions and you have to constantly make sure they don’t break anything and review their commits very closely and write explanatory comments on why their code is not good.</p> 
<p>If you have the time and resources for all of this, than prepare to reap the benefits that come with having a Junior like: fixing pixels and aligning divs, rewriting legacy code, refactoring, debugging and other tedious jobs that the Juniors find utterly engaging and interesting.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the time or resources, don’t take on this responsibility. Juniors need a lot of attention and care so they can grow into your best developer superstars.</p>  
<p>This particular Junior thrives better in international and English speaking teams, since Swedish is not her native language and she feels shy to speak it.</p>
