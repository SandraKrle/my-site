	Ok, to be honest, it’s like the more I learn the less I know. Obviously, I have no fancy university diploma in Computer Science (just one in Finance, boring right) and all I know is from the interwebz and the Internships I’ve done so far.

<p>To summarize it (is not much): I’m good with CSS and preprocessors (SASS, SCSS and Stylus). I know how to create responsive layouts, so it looks nice and customers are happy and not like uugh I can’t read this stuff.
JavaScript of course, although I still have more learning to do here. I’m most comfortable with JQuery, but also Angular (not 2) because I worked with that in my last internship. 
I’ve also written and fixed some basic unit and e2e tests
On the backend side I’ve used Django templating, REST APIs and some Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>I know, I am so 2014, ‘cause I haven’t started with React…buut I will. Soon. Plus, I am being smart and avoiding the “JavaScript fatigue” (google it, it’s real) and focusing on mastering plain ol’ JavaScript cause I thinks that is the most important.</p>
